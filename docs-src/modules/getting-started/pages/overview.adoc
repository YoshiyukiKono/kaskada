== Why Kaskada?

With Kaskada, you can connect directly to your event-based data and
calculate aggregated feature values at any point in time to train models
without the risk of leakage.

When youâ€™re ready, you can compute the current value of the same
features to make predictions using the latest data and a live model in
production.

== Simplified Process

[arabic]
. Connect your event-based data
. Build and iterate with familiar interfaces
. Share features as code
. Deploy feature vectors to production

== Rapidly Author and Iterate on Features

Features are composed using xref:fenl:language-guide.adoc[Fenl], a query language
designed for authoring and sharing feature definitions.

Fenl expressions are _temporal_ -- they describe how the result of a
computation changes over time rather than just the current result.
Temporal queries make it easy to reconstruct the information available
at arbitrary times in the past.

The rich time-traveling tools provided by Fenl make it easy to build
training datasets without leaking knowledge of the future.

== Go Directly to Production

Collaborate by sharing code, not just data. Fenl's composability allows
you to share and re-use cleaned or pre-aggregated expressions.

Authoring in Fenl ensures your features are scalable, reproducible, and
can be computed incrementally.

Features can be exported to external storage for training. When you're
ready to host a model, the same feature definitions used in training can
be continuously written to a feature-vector cache.
