= Quick Start

This quick start is intended to get you comfortable working with Kaskada
quickly.

Kaskada is a fully managed feature engine. Most interactions with
Kaskada are performed via an API. A Python client library is provided to
make interacting with the API as easy as possible.

This tutorial assumes that you are working in an IPython environment
such as Jupyter.

Over the next 4 pages, you will learn how to:

[arabic]
. Install and set up our Python client library in a notebook
environment.
. Create a table and load data into the table.
. Write queries over the table and see results.
. Save a query as a view, for sharing in other notebooks or use in
production.
