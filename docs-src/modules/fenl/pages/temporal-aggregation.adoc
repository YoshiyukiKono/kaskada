= Temporal Aggregations

Time plays a critical role when working with event-based data and
event-based models. The ability to calculate point-in-time historical
feature values is one of the core features of Kaskada.

Rather than computing a single value, Fenl expressions produce temporal
streams describing the result of a given computation as its changes over
time.

== Solving the Challenge of Event-Based Data

Kaskada is an event-based computation engine. An "event" can be any fact
about the world associated with a time, for example, a user signing up
for a service, or a customer purchasing a product. Most sources of
event-based data change over time as events occur and are added to the
system. Computing values from a set of events that changes over time
means that the results must change as well.

Traditional data processing systems are designed to answer questions
about the _current_ state of a dataset, for instance, "how many
purchases has a given user made?". This approach has some drawbacks: the
answer to a given question changes based on when it is asked, and the
only time at which you can ask questions is "now".

These limitations are reasonable for many use cases, but they make it
difficult to build feature examples for training many machine learning
models. A common error is accidentally using information that is known
"now" to build training examples intended to describe the information
available in the past.

The way traditional computations are _expressed_ doesn't help matters.
Query languages like SQL and data-processing interfaces like DataFrames
were designed to answer questions about tabular (rather than temporal)
data. Seemingly simple questions like "how many fraud reports had been
filed against each purchase's vendor at the time of purchase?" can
require complex windowing and partitioning operations.

== How Fenl Deals with Time

Fenl takes a different approach by designing awareness of time into the
query language.

=== Value Streams

Rather than answering a question with a single value, Fenl produces a
stream of values describing the answer as it changes over time. For
example, the answer to the question "how many purchases has a given user
made?" might be the following table:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Time |Purchase \| count()
|2012-02-23 |1
|2012-05-10 |2
|2018-11-03 |3
|2019-10-26 |4
|===

From this table we can see that if the question was asked in
2015 the answer would be "the user has made _two_ purchases", but if the
question was asked now the answer would be "the user has made _four_
purchases".

=== Final Results

Often it is valuable to know the "final" answer to a question - the last
answer that would be produced after all values have been processed. Fenl
provides the ability to request `final-results` for these use cases. The
result of query with result behavior set to `final-results` would be the
following:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Time |Purchase | count()
|2019-10-26 |4
|===

Final queries make it possible to know the "current" value of
a query. Incremental queries and materializations always use final
queries.

=== Temporally-Correct Joins

A core feature of Fenl is the ability to compute temporal joins across
datasets. For example the question "how many fraud reports had been
filed against each purchase's vendor at the time of purchase?" can be
written in a single line.

[source,fenl]
----
FraudReport | count() | lookup(Purchase.vendor_id)
----
