= Integrating with Apache Pulsar

Apache Pulsar is an open-source distributed streaming platform.

== Writing to Pulsar

Query results can be written to Pulsar in real-time by creating a materialization. 

[source,python]

tenant = "public"
namespace = "default"
topic_name = "model_features"
broker_service_url = "pulsar://127.0.0.1:6650"
destination = materialization.PulsarDestination(tenant, namespace, topic_name, broker_service_url)

materialization.create_materialization(
    name = "MaterializedFeatures",
    destination = destination,
    query = "{
      key: Purchase.customer_id,
      max_amount: Purchase.amount | max(),
      min_amount: Purchase.amount | min(),
    }"
)
